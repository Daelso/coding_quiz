# 04 JavaScript: Coding Quiz

## Description:
This homework was to create a short coding quiz that would store scores with initials.

This really tested my javascript skills thus far. It also taught me a lot about how local storage works. By far the hardest part was the scores/initials. I had to really think about the logic of how storage and arrays interact along with JSON. It was challenging but fun. At the end here I think I could've improved how questions were answered, but it works for now!

I wish I could figure out how to sort by score but I'm happy with how it turned out as I keep looking into that.
